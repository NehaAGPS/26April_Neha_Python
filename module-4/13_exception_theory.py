#Explain Exception handling? What is an Error in Python?

#Ans:

#Exceptions handling in Python is very similar to Java.
#But where as in Java exceptions are caught by catch clauses, 
#we have statements introduced by an "except" keyword in Python.
#A try statement may have more than one except clause for different exceptions.
#But at most one except clause will be executed.
#it is used for programming error.
