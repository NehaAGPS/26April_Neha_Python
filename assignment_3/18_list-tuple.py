# What is tuple? Difference between list and tuple.

# Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. 
# Allows duplicate members.

t1=(1,2,3,4)
t2=("a","b","c")
t3=(1,2,"b")

print(t1)
print(t2)
print(t3)

#The literal syntax of tuples is shown by parentheses () whereas the literal syntax of lists is shown by square brackets [] .
#Lists has variable length, tuple has fixed length.
#List has mutable nature, tuple has immutable nature.
#List has more functionality than the tuple.
